TIPS:

Know your moves. Scorcher is not a projectile oriented fighter, but he doesn't need them. Use flash step and run away tactics to both avoid oncoming projectiles and pressure your opponent into your hit zone.

Counter blow also works against projectiles. Suprise a projectile abusing opponent.
