
      SHINKUU HADOUKEN
          -D, DF, F, two punches (can be done in air)
             Big H charges up and fires a large, multi-hitting
             energy beam at his opponent. This is almost impossible
             to jump over as the beam stretches all the way accross
             the screen.


      SHINKUU TATSUMAKI SENPUU KYAKU
          -D, DB, B, two kicks (can be done in air)
             Big H does a Tatsumaki Senpuu Kyaku from where he's
             standing, and it lasts a lot longer than the normal
             move. If the opponent comes too close, he/she will get
             sucked in and get a major whoppin'. The air version is
             basically the same except Ryu will slowly glide down
             while spinning in the air.


      MESSATSU GOU SHOURYUU
          -D, DF, F, two kicks
             This is basically three Shouryuu Kens strung together,
             with the third one rising into the air. Not much more
             to say about it.


      SHIN SHOURYUU KEN
          -D, DB, B, two punches
             Big H charges with an elbow strike and if the move
             connects, he does a left uppercut, right uppercut,
             and then finally hits the opponent with a left
             Shouryuu Ken.


      TENMA GOU ZANKUU
          -D, DB, B, two punches (while in the air)
             Big H throws out a multitude of Hadoukens at the opponent
             that are angled down. A cool move, but the slow start-up
             time makes it nearly impossible to combo into it. But
             it's still fun watching the opponent get hit with a
             barrage of fireballs.
