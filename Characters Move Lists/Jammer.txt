/Gems

There are six different gems: Mind, Power, Reality, Soul, Space, and
 Time.  Mind adds to your power meter and Power makes you stronger.
 Reality creates objects out of nothing, Soul replenishes the life guage,
 Space will give you super armor, and Time will allow you to move faster.

If you hit your enemy with a special or hyper combo, you will see a Gem
 pop out of them.  Only one free gem can be on the field at one time.
 Your enemy can pick up ones that are dropped to keep you from getting
 them, so you'd better rush after those things.  Occasionally, you won't
 get a gem at all.  Call it a stroke of bad luck.  :P
